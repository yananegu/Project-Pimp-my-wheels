# Pimp My Wheels
**Status**: The project is ongoing and not yet completed. Regular updates and progress details will be posted in this repository.

## Project Description
This repository is dedicated to the design and implementation of a database for "Pimp My Wheels," a workshop that not only operates as a traditional garage but also engages in the purchase, restoration, and sale of cars and motorcycles. The project is structured into four key phases and is currently in progress.

1. **Design and Creation of the Database Schema**: Crafting a structured database schema tailored to the needs of the automotive and motorcycle sales and restoration business.
2. **Scripted Database Population**: Developing scripts for populating the database with relevant data to simulate real-world operations.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the stored data to extract meaningful insights that could influence business decisions.
4. **Reporting**: Compiling the analysis results into comprehensive reports to inform stakeholders and guide business strategies.


## Components
- **Schema Design**: Detailing the structure and relationships within the database.
- **Data Entry Scripts**: Scripts used to populate the database efficiently and consistently.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Techniques and tools applied to analyze the data, focusing on sales trends, restoration costs, and operational efficiency.
- **Report Generation**: Format and tools used for creating reports that visualize and summarize the analysis findings.

This project serves as a practical application of database design principles, data management, and analytical reporting in a business context, particularly within the automotive industry.
