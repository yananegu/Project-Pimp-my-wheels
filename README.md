# Pimp My Wheels

## Project Description
This repository is dedicated to implementation of a database for "Pimp My Wheels," a workshop that not only operates as a traditional garage but also engages in the purchase, restoration, and sale of cars and motorcycles. The project is structured into four key phases and is currently in progress.

1. **Creation of the Database Schema**: Crafting a structured database schema tailored to the needs of the automotive and motorcycle sales and restoration business.
2. **Scripted Database Population**: Developing scripts for populating the database with relevant data to simulate real-world operations.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the stored data to extract meaningful insights that could influence business decisions.
4. **Reporting**: Compiling the analysis results into comprehensive report.


## Components
**Schema Design** ('PimpMyWheelsSchema.vuerd.json').
**Data Entry Scripts** ('main.py'): Scripts used to populate the database efficiently and consistently. 

**Data Analysis Tools** ('report_PimpMyWheels.qmd'): Techniques and tools applied to analyze the data, focusing on sales trends, restoration costs, and operational efficiency.
**Report Generation** ('report_PimpMyWheels.pdf'): Format and tools used for creating reports that visualize and summarize the analysis findings.
**Documentation** ('ddocumentation.docx') includes:
      - A list of technologies used.
      - A list of files and their contents.
      - Instructions for running the project.
      - The database schema and functional dependency descriptions.
      - Justification for the database being in BCNF.
      - A description of the challenges encountered during the project

This project serves as a practical application of database design principles, data management, and analytical reporting in a business context, particularly within the automotive industry.
